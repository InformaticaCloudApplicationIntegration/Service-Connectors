Overview
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Blue Button API enables Medicare beneficiaries to connect their Medicare claims data to the applications, services, and research programs they trust.
The CMS Blue Button API:
•	Enables a developer to register a beneficiary-facing application
•	Enables a beneficiary to grant an application access to four years of their Part A, B, and D claims data
•	Uses the HL7 FHIR standard for beneficiary data and the OAuth 2.0 standard for beneficiary authorization
