          "description": "UTC Time Stamp in Long Form (YYYYMMDDhhmmssmmmuuun)  \nThe UTC timestamp displays date and time according to UTC (Universal Coordinated Time).  \nIn order to convert local time into a UTC time stamp, which makes it easier to compare times, the local time must be converted according to your time zone. The ABAP command convert is available for this purpose.Even if the time zone that the conversion is based on can be redetermined from Customizing or master data, we still recommend that you save the time zone.The internal structure of the high-resolution UTC time stamp is logically organized in date and time sections in a packed decimal format (YYYYMMDDhhmmssmmmuuun), which depicts the year, month, day, hour,second, millisecond, microsecond and the first decimal of the nanoseconds. Please note that the hardware that is normally used does not fully support a resolution of 100 nanoseconds, which is available in the structure.See also GET TIME STAMPA UTC time stamp in short form is also available."

You can distribute the costs assigned to the nodes of a cost object hierarchy directly to the individual objects in the lowest cost object nodes at period-end closing (for example, product cost collectors) or you can settle the costs directly from the cost object hierarchy to a price difference account.Product Cost Controlling Information System (CO-PC)You can create further cost object IDs in the Product Cost Controlling Information System for CO product groups. You can create a cost object ID for each group, and assign materials to the cost object ID. The costs of the assigned materials appear in summarized form in the information system by product group.You can use CO product groups for product drilldown reports.The cost object type determines which functions can be used with the cost object.

It is a working copy that can be modified as many times as needed.ProposalWhen the initial draft becomes a formal and complete document, it becomes a proposal.ApplicationWhen a proposal is routed to the sponsor for approval, it becomes an application. This application might contain changes in the budget or other adjustments.AwardIf the sponsor approves an application, an award is created. This is the real operative stage of a grant. The creation and consumption of the grant's budget occurs at this stage. This stage also represents the binding contract between the sponsor and the grantee.ClosingWhen an award is expiring, a phase of closing is established.

The R/3 System distinguishes between the following types of cost objects:Cost objects represented by a cost object IDCost objects represented by objects from other components, such as production orders or sales order itemsCost objects in the following areas are represented by cost object IDs:Activity-Based Costing (CO-OM-ABC)In Activity-Based Costing, overhead is first assigned to cost centers and then to business processes. From there, the overhead is assigned to cost objects as process costs.Costs for Intangible Goods and Services (CO-PC-OBJ)In Costs for Intangible Goods and Services, costs can be analyzed on general cost objects.Product Cost by Period (CO-PC-OBJ)In Product Cost by Period you can create a cost object hierarchy to record actual costs that cannot be recorded at the material or order level. You can distribute the costs assigned to the nodes of a cost object hierarchy directly to the individual objects in the lowest cost object nodes at period-end closing (for example, product cost collectors) or you can settle the costs directly from the cost object hierarchy to a price difference account.Product Cost Controlling Information System (CO-PC)You can create further cost object IDs in the Product Cost Controlling Information System for CO product groups. You can create a cost object ID for each group, and assign materials to the cost object ID. The costs of the assigned materials appear in summarized form in the information system by product group.You can use CO product groups for product drilldown reports.The cost object type determines which functions can be used with the cost object. Functions for cost object hierarchies are performed on the assumption that the given cost object indicates the top node of the hierarchy."

It is a working copy that can be modified as many times as needed.ProposalWhen the initial draft becomes a formal and complete document, it becomes a proposal.ApplicationWhen a proposal is routed to the sponsor for approval, it becomes an application. This application might contain changes in the budget or other adjustments.AwardIf the sponsor approves an application, an award is created. This is the real operative stage of a grant. The creation and consumption of the grant's budget occurs at this stage.

The R/3 System distinguishes between the following types of cost objects:Cost objects represented by a cost object IDCost objects represented by objects from other components, such as production orders or sales order itemsCost objects in the following areas are represented by cost object IDs:Activity-Based Costing (CO-OM-ABC)In Activity-Based Costing, overhead is first assigned to cost centers and then to business processes. From there, the overhead is assigned to cost objects as process costs.Costs for Intangible Goods and Services (CO-PC-OBJ)In Costs for Intangible Goods and Services, costs can be analyzed on general cost objects.Product Cost by Period (CO-PC-OBJ)In Product Cost by Period you can create a cost object hierarchy to record actual costs that cannot be recorded at the material or order level. You can distribute the costs assigned to the nodes of a cost object hierarchy directly to the individual objects in the lowest cost object nodes at period-end closing (for example, product cost collectors) or you can settle the costs directly from the cost object hierarchy to a price difference account.Product Cost Controlling Information System (CO-PC)You can create further cost object IDs in the Product Cost Controlling Information System for CO product groups. You can create a cost object ID for each group, and assign materials to the cost object ID. The costs of the assigned materials appear in summarized form in the information system by product group.You can use CO product groups for product drilldown reports.The cost object type determines which functions can be used with the cost object. Functions for cost object hierarchies are performed on the assumption that the given cost object indicates the top node of the hierarchy."

It is a working copy that can be modified as many times as needed.ProposalWhen the initial draft becomes a formal and complete document, it becomes a proposal.ApplicationWhen a proposal is routed to the sponsor for approval, it becomes an application. This application might contain changes in the budget or other adjustments.AwardIf the sponsor approves an application, an award is created. This is the real operative stage of a grant. The creation and consumption of the grant's budget occurs at this stage. This stage also represents the binding contract between the sponsor and the grantee.ClosingWhen an award is expiring, a phase of closing is established.

When you define a client, you can specify which logical system corresponds to the client.The logical system is important in the following SAP areas:ALE generally, where communication takes place between two or more logical systems.ALE distribution scenarios (for example, cost center accounting) where a system running a particular application is defined. Only in this system, for example, can master data be changed,Workflow objects: The object key always contains the logical system where the object is located.When you define the logical system keep in mind that:The logical system must be unique company-wide. No other system in the ALE system group can be used.The logical system must not be changed in the productive system, once a non-initial value has been specified. If a logical system with a non- initial value is changed afterwards, you may not be able to find documents in your own system. If the logical system specified in a document reference is not the same as your own system, the system assumes the document is located in a different system."
