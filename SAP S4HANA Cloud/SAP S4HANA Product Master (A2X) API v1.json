A quantity in the alternative unit of measure can only be shown precisely if its value can be shown with the decimal places available. To ensure this, please note the following:The base unit of measure is the unit satisfying the highest necessary requirement for precision.The conversion of alternative units of measure to the base unit should result in simple decimal fractions (not, for example, 1/3 = 0.333...).Inventory ManagementIn Inventory Management, the base unit of measure is the same as the stockkeeping unit.ServicesServices have units of measure of their own, including the following:Service unitUnit of measure at the higher item level.
