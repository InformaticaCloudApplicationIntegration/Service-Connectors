From there, the overhead is assigned to cost objects as process costs.Costs for Intangible Goods and Services (CO-PC-OBJ)In Costs for Intangible Goods and Services, costs can be analyzed on general cost objects.Product Cost by Period (CO-PC-OBJ)In Product Cost by Period you can create a cost object hierarchy to record actual costs that cannot be recorded at the material or order level. You can distribute the costs assigned to the nodes of a cost object hierarchy directly to the individual objects in the lowest cost object nodes at period-end closing (for example, product cost collectors) or you can settle the costs directly from the cost object hierarchy to a price difference account.Product Cost Controlling Information System (CO-PC)You can create further cost object IDs in the Product Cost Controlling Information System for CO product groups. You can create a cost object ID for each group, and assign materials to the cost object ID. The costs of the assigned materials appear in summarized form in the information system by product group.You can use CO product groups for product drilldown reports.The cost object type determines which functions can be used with the cost object.

From there, the overhead is assigned to cost objects as process costs.Costs for Intangible Goods and Services (CO-PC-OBJ)In Costs for Intangible Goods and Services, costs can be analyzed on general cost objects.Product Cost by Period (CO-PC-OBJ)In Product Cost by Period you can create a cost object hierarchy to record actual costs that cannot be recorded at the material or order level. You can distribute the costs assigned to the nodes of a cost object hierarchy directly to the individual objects in the lowest cost object nodes at period-end closing (for example, product cost collectors) or you can settle the costs directly from the cost object hierarchy to a price difference account.Product Cost Controlling Information System (CO-PC)You can create further cost object IDs in the Product Cost Controlling Information System for CO product groups. You can create a cost object ID for each group, and assign materials to the cost object ID. The costs of the assigned materials appear in summarized form in the information system by product group.You can use CO product groups for product drilldown reports.The cost object type determines which functions can be used with the cost object. Functions for cost object hierarchies are performed on the assumption that the given cost object indicates the top node of the hierarchy."

From there, the overhead is assigned to cost objects as process costs.Costs for Intangible Goods and Services (CO-PC-OBJ)In Costs for Intangible Goods and Services, costs can be analyzed on general cost objects.Product Cost by Period (CO-PC-OBJ)In Product Cost by Period you can create a cost object hierarchy to record actual costs that cannot be recorded at the material or order level. You can distribute the costs assigned to the nodes of a cost object hierarchy directly to the individual objects in the lowest cost object nodes at period-end closing (for example, product cost collectors) or you can settle the costs directly from the cost object hierarchy to a price difference account.Product Cost Controlling Information System (CO-PC)You can create further cost object IDs in the Product Cost Controlling Information System for CO product groups. You can create a cost object ID for each group, and assign materials to the cost object ID. The costs of the assigned materials appear in summarized form in the information system by product group.You can use CO product groups for product drilldown reports.The cost object type determines which functions can be used with the cost object.

The orderer will recompense him in full for such outlay (but not for any other production costs) in the event that he should subsequently cancel the scheduled quantity.Schedule lines that lie beyond the firm and trade-off zones fall within the planning zone (forecast zone) and are for rough guidance only, being without any commitment on the part of the orderer.In the \"Firm zone\" field, enter the number of calendar days (calculated from the SA release creation date) after which the firm zone ends and the trade-off zone begins.In the \"Trade-off zone\" field, enter the number of calendar days (calculated from the SA release creation date) after which the trade-off zone ends.If the firm zone ends in one month, enter 30 in the \"Firm zone\" field.If the trade-off zone ends one month after the firm zone, enter 60 in the \"Trade-off zone\" field.In the standard system, the end date for production go-ahead is calculated at the time of SA release creation from the firm zone. The end date for material go-ahead is calculated from the trade-off zone. These dates are displayed in the header of the relevant scheduling agreement release.When an SA release is transmitted to the supplier via IDoc, the end dates for production and material go-ahead are determined from the firm and trade-off zones and the SA release creation date. These dates are shown in the sales scheduling agreement in the SA release header in the relevant fields (End of Production Go-Ahead,  End of Material Go-Ahead)."
