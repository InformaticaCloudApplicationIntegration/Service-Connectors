          "description": "Identifies, together with the Creditor Identifier, the mandate uniquely.  \nThe mandate reference can be specified externally or be determined by internal number assignment. The system determines 12 digit numerical mandate references for the internal number assignment.Whether internal or external number assignment (or both) is possible depends on the application concerned.Once you have created the mandate, you can no longer change its mandate reference.At event 0570, you can implement different logic using your own installation-specific function module. Register the function module in Customizing for Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable under Business Transactions -> Incoming/Outgoing Payment Creation -> Management of SEPA Mandates -> General Settings in the Mandate Reference field.Notes on Assigning Contract Accounts and Contracts to MandatesYou can enter a mandate reference in various FI-CA objects (such as, the document item, the contract account, or the contract). The effect of entering a reference is that the system uses the entered mandate for this object during payment.Notes on Using Alternative PayersIf you want to enter an alternative payer P1 for business partner B1 with contract account C1, you have to enter the mandate for this alternative payer P1. If the mandate is to be used now exclusively for paying postings on B1, then enter B1 in the field Payment for Alternative Debtor/ID on the lower part of the screen. If you want the mandate to be used only for a certain contract account of B1 (for instance, for C1), then enter the ID of this contract account in the Contract Account field on the upper part of the screen.ExampleYou enter mandate M1 in contract account C1. When items of contract C1 are paid, the system uses mandate M1.Using a mandate for one object does not exclude using it for another object. That means, for example, that you could also enter mandate M1 in contract C2 as the mandate to be used. In that case, no contract account is entered in the mandate itself, so that it can be referenced from multiple objects.Example - Assignment of a mandate to multiple contract accountsContract account Mandate (in Contract Acct) MeaningC1 M1 Mandate M1 is valid for C1.C2 M1 Mandate M1 is also valid for C2.C3 M2 Mandate M2 is valid for C3.C4 M2 Mandate M2 is also valid for C4.Another alternative is to enter the contract account in the mandate itself. The result of making this assignment, however, is that the mandate can only be used (exclusively) for the payment of items of this one contract account.Example - Assignment of one contract account per mandateMandate Contract Account (in Mandate) MeaningM1 C1 Mandate M1 is only valid for items of contract account C1.M2 C2 Mandate M2 is only valid for items of contract account C2.If you want a mandate to be used by several FI-CA objects (such as, document, contract account, or contract), enter the mandate only in the given objects.The examples above apply in a similar manner to the assignment of contracts.Even if you do not enter payment data at the contract level in contracts of the various industry components that use Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable, it can be useful to make an assignment between the contract and the mandate. This makes it possible to have the system pay postings assigned to a contract using a specific mandate.If you do not make any assignments between FI-CA objects (such as, document, contract account, or contract) and a mandate, the system determines the mandate from the bank details entered in the payment data of the payer. In doing so, the system compares the IBAN in the mandate with the IBAN of the bank details.If there are several active mandates for the same bank details of the payer, but there are no additional assignments between the mandate and the FI-CA object, you can use event 0653 to specify which of the mandates is used for making the payment.If you do not make any specification, the system uses the first mandate that qualifies for the payment.",

The effect of entering a reference is that the system uses the entered mandate for this object during payment.Notes on Using Alternative PayersIf you want to enter an alternative payer P1 for business partner B1 with contract account C1, you have to enter the mandate for this alternative payer P1. If the mandate is to be used now exclusively for paying postings on B1, then enter B1 in the field Payment for Alternative Debtor/ID on the lower part of the screen. If you want the mandate to be used only for a certain contract account of B1 (for instance, for C1), then enter the ID of this contract account in the Contract Account field on the upper part of the screen.ExampleYou enter mandate M1 in contract account C1. When items of contract C1 are paid, the system uses mandate M1.Using a mandate for one object does not exclude using it for another object. That means, for example, that you could also enter mandate M1 in contract C2 as the mandate to be used. In that case, no contract account is entered in the mandate itself, so that it can be referenced from multiple objects.Example - Assignment of a mandate to multiple contract accountsContract account Mandate (in Contract Acct) MeaningC1 M1 Mandate M1 is valid for C1.C2 M1 Mandate M1 is also valid for C2.C3 M2 Mandate M2 is valid for C3.C4 M2 Mandate M2 is also valid for C4.Another alternative is to enter the contract account in the mandate itself. The result of making this assignment, however, is that the mandate can only be used (exclusively) for the payment of items of this one contract account.Example - Assignment of one contract account per mandateMandate Contract Account (in Mandate) MeaningM1 C1 Mandate M1 is only valid for items of contract account C1.M2 C2 Mandate M2 is only valid for items of contract account C2.If you want a mandate to be used by several FI-CA objects (such as, document, contract account, or contract), enter the mandate only in the given objects.The examples above apply in a similar manner to the assignment of contracts.Even if you do not enter payment data at the contract level in contracts of the various industry components that use Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable, it can be useful to make an assignment between the contract and the mandate. This makes it possible to have the system pay postings assigned to a contract using a specific mandate.If you do not make any assignments between FI-CA objects (such as, document, contract account, or contract) and a mandate, the system determines the mandate from the bank details entered in the payment data of the payer. In doing so, the system compares the IBAN in the mandate with the IBAN of the bank details.If there are several active mandates for the same bank details of the payer, but there are no additional assignments between the mandate and the FI-CA object, you can use event 0653 to specify which of the mandates is used for making the payment.If you do not make any specification, the system uses the first mandate that qualifies for the payment.",

In doing so, the system compares the IBAN in the mandate with the IBAN of the bank details.If there are several active mandates for the same bank details of the payer, but there are no additional assignments between the mandate and the FI-CA object, you can use event 0653 to specify which of the mandates is used for making the payment.If you do not make any specification, the system uses the first mandate that qualifies for the payment.",

The system determines 12 digit numerical mandate references for the internal number assignment.Whether internal or external number assignment (or both) is possible depends on the application concerned.Once you have created the mandate, you can no longer change its mandate reference.At event 0570, you can implement different logic using your own installation-specific function module. Register the function module in Customizing for Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable under Business Transactions -> Incoming/Outgoing Payment Creation -> Management of SEPA Mandates -> General Settings in the Mandate Reference field.Notes on Assigning Contract Accounts and Contracts to MandatesYou can enter a mandate reference in various FI-CA objects (such as, the document item, the contract account, or the contract). The effect of entering a reference is that the system uses the entered mandate for this object during payment.Notes on Using Alternative PayersIf you want to enter an alternative payer P1 for business partner B1 with contract account C1, you have to enter the mandate for this alternative payer P1. If the mandate is to be used now exclusively for paying postings on B1, then enter B1 in the field Payment for Alternative Debtor/ID on the lower part of the screen. If you want the mandate to be used only for a certain contract account of B1 (for instance, for C1), then enter the ID of this contract account in the Contract Account field on the upper part of the screen.ExampleYou enter mandate M1 in contract account C1. When items of contract C1 are paid, the system uses mandate M1.Using a mandate for one object does not exclude using it for another object. That means, for example, that you could also enter mandate M1 in contract C2 as the mandate to be used. In that case, no contract account is entered in the mandate itself, so that it can be referenced from multiple objects.Example - Assignment of a mandate to multiple contract accountsContract account Mandate (in Contract Acct) MeaningC1 M1 Mandate M1 is valid for C1.C2 M1 Mandate M1 is also valid for C2.C3 M2 Mandate M2 is valid for C3.C4 M2 Mandate M2 is also valid for C4.Another alternative is to enter the contract account in the mandate itself.

          "description": "Unique Reference to Mandate for each Payee  \nIdentifies, together with the Creditor Identifier, the mandate uniquely.  \nThe mandate reference can be specified externally or be determined by internal number assignment. The system determines 12 digit numerical mandate references for the internal number assignment.Whether internal or external number assignment (or both) is possible depends on the application concerned.Once you have created the mandate, you can no longer change its mandate reference.At event 0570, you can implement different logic using your own installation-specific function module. Register the function module in Customizing for Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable under Business Transactions -> Incoming/Outgoing Payment Creation -> Management of SEPA Mandates -> General Settings in the Mandate Reference field.Notes on Assigning Contract Accounts and Contracts to MandatesYou can enter a mandate reference in various FI-CA objects (such as, the document item, the contract account, or the contract). The effect of entering a reference is that the system uses the entered mandate for this object during payment.Notes on Using Alternative PayersIf you want to enter an alternative payer P1 for business partner B1 with contract account C1, you have to enter the mandate for this alternative payer P1. If the mandate is to be used now exclusively for paying postings on B1, then enter B1 in the field Payment for Alternative Debtor/ID on the lower part of the screen. If you want the mandate to be used only for a certain contract account of B1 (for instance, for C1), then enter the ID of this contract account in the Contract Account field on the upper part of the screen.ExampleYou enter mandate M1 in contract account C1. When items of contract C1 are paid, the system uses mandate M1.Using a mandate for one object does not exclude using it for another object. That means, for example, that you could also enter mandate M1 in contract C2 as the mandate to be used. In that case, no contract account is entered in the mandate itself, so that it can be referenced from multiple objects.Example - Assignment of a mandate to multiple contract accountsContract account Mandate (in Contract Acct) MeaningC1 M1 Mandate M1 is valid for C1.C2 M1 Mandate M1 is also valid for C2.C3 M2 Mandate M2 is valid for C3.C4 M2 Mandate M2 is also valid for C4.Another alternative is to enter the contract account in the mandate itself. The result of making this assignment, however, is that the mandate can only be used (exclusively) for the payment of items of this one contract account.Example - Assignment of one contract account per mandateMandate Contract Account (in Mandate) MeaningM1 C1 Mandate M1 is only valid for items of contract account C1.M2 C2 Mandate M2 is only valid for items of contract account C2.If you want a mandate to be used by several FI-CA objects (such as, document, contract account, or contract), enter the mandate only in the given objects.The examples above apply in a similar manner to the assignment of contracts.Even if you do not enter payment data at the contract level in contracts of the various industry components that use Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable, it can be useful to make an assignment between the contract and the mandate. This makes it possible to have the system pay postings assigned to a contract using a specific mandate.If you do not make any assignments between FI-CA objects (such as, document, contract account, or contract) and a mandate, the system determines the mandate from the bank details entered in the payment data of the payer. In doing so, the system compares the IBAN in the mandate with the IBAN of the bank details.If there are several active mandates for the same bank details of the payer, but there are no additional assignments between the mandate and the FI-CA object, you can use event 0653 to specify which of the mandates is used for making the payment.If you do not make any specification, the system uses the first mandate that qualifies for the payment."
