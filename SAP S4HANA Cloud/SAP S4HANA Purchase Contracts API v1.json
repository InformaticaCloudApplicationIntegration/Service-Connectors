It is a working copy that can be modified as many times as needed.ProposalWhen the initial draft becomes a formal and complete document, it becomes a proposal.ApplicationWhen a proposal is routed to the sponsor for approval, it becomes an application. This application might contain changes in the budget or other adjustments.AwardIf the sponsor approves an application, an award is created. This is the real operative stage of a grant. The creation and consumption of the grant's budget occurs at this stage. This stage also represents the binding contract between the sponsor and the grantee.ClosingWhen an award is expiring, a phase of closing is established.

From there, the overhead is assigned to cost objects as process costs.Costs for Intangible Goods and Services (CO-PC-OBJ)In Costs for Intangible Goods and Services, costs can be analyzed on general cost objects.Product Cost by Period (CO-PC-OBJ)In Product Cost by Period you can create a cost object hierarchy to record actual costs that cannot be recorded at the material or order level. You can distribute the costs assigned to the nodes of a cost object hierarchy directly to the individual objects in the lowest cost object nodes at period-end closing (for example, product cost collectors) or you can settle the costs directly from the cost object hierarchy to a price difference account.Product Cost Controlling Information System (CO-PC)You can create further cost object IDs in the Product Cost Controlling Information System for CO product groups. You can create a cost object ID for each group, and assign materials to the cost object ID. The costs of the assigned materials appear in summarized form in the information system by product group.You can use CO product groups for product drilldown reports.The cost object type determines which functions can be used with the cost object.

You must enter a grant type for each grant you create in Grants Management (GM).The grant as an object has a finite lifecycle, divided into stages. Each stage is represented in the GM solution by a system status. The following are the stages of a grant's lifecycle:Initial DraftThis is the first stage of a grant. It is a working copy that can be modified as many times as needed.ProposalWhen the initial draft becomes a formal and complete document, it becomes a proposal.ApplicationWhen a proposal is routed to the sponsor for approval, it becomes an application. This application might contain changes in the budget or other adjustments.AwardIf the sponsor approves an application, an award is created. This is the real operative stage of a grant. The creation and consumption of the grant's budget occurs at this stage. This stage also represents the binding contract between the sponsor and the grantee.ClosingWhen an award is expiring, a phase of closing is established. Only restricted operations can be performed in this stage.ClosedThis stage defines an expired and closed grant. No further operations are allowed except archiving."
