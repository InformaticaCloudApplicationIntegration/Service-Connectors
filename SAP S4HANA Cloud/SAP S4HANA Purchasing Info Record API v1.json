The base unit of measure is piece (PC). 5 kg correspond to 3 pieces.5 kg = 3 PC   =>   1 kg = 3/5 PCIn this case, the quotient is therefore 3/5 (the numerator being 3 and the denominator 5).You may enter only whole numbers in the numerator and denominator fields; that is, if 3.14 m² correspond to one piece, you must enter integer multiples (314 m² = 100 PC). In this case, the quotient is therefore 100/314 (the numerator being 100 and the denominator 314)."
