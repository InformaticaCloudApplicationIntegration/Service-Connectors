The  information is sent in the request as a payload.  All information is used when creating a  purchasing source list, and they are checked  for authorizations. Once the purchasing source  list has been created, the purchasing source  list number is sent in the response. If there  are any issues when the purchasing source list  is created, the system displays error messages  in the response."
