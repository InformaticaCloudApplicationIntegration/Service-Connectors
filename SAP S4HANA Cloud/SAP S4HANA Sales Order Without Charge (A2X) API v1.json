Typical examples of distribution channels are wholesale, retail, or direct sales.  \nYou can maintain information about customers and materials by sales organization and distribution channel. Within a sales organization you can deliver goods to a given customer through more than one distribution channel.You can assign a distribution channel to one or more sales organizations. If, for example, you have numerous sales organizations, each sales organization may use the \"Wholesale\" distribution channel.For each combination of sales organization and distribution channel, you can further assign one or more of the divisions that are defined for the sales organization. You can, for example, assign \"Food\" and \"Non-food\" divisions to the \"Wholesale\" distribution channel. A particular combination of sales organization, distribution channel, and division is known as a sales area."
