| Expedia Hotwire API | Hotwire QuickConnect is a set of APIs that allow a client system to interact with the information available in the Hotwire Hotel Extranet. In turn, that information is used by Hotwire.com and its affiliates to display and sell hotel rooms to travelers. Currently the Hotwire QuickConnect API can be used to create and update a hotel’s availability, rates, and inventory (ARI), and retrieve recently confirmed and/or cancelled bookings. The ARI functionality includes the ability to set the number of available rooms, per-day rate amounts and extra person charges, and several restrictions. Retrieved bookings contain guest and Hotwire single use credit card information. | Expedia Hotwire API.wsdl | Expedia Hotwire API.zip |
